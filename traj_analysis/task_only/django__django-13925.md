Consider the following PR description:
models.W042 is raised on inherited manually specified primary key.
Description
	
I have models which inherit from other models, and they should inherit the primary key. This works fine with Django 3.1. However, if I install Django 3.2 alpha, when I run make_migrations I get the following error messages:
System check identified some issues:

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands) and task_description.txt
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specific, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specific and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file
- Anytime you execute commands that provide insight into the issue you are solving, you MUST add these insights to the task description before proceeding!

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.
</instructions>

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: I need to inspect the repository to understand the structure, locate Django-related code, and identify where DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD or model inheritance around primary keys might be handled. I'll start by listing the directory recursively to see relevant files.

```bash
ls -la && ls -la testbed || find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -print
```

THOUGHT: I need to locate where Django defines and emits the models.W042 warning to understand the current logic and why it triggers for subclasses inheriting a primary key. Then I'll plan edits to ensure the check skips models that already inherit a manually specified primary key from an ancestor. I'll start by searching the codebase for W042 and related check definitions.

```bash
grep -Rn "W042" -n django || grep -Rin "Auto-created primary key used" django

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly. Anytime you execute commands that provide insight into the issue you are solving, you MUST add these insights to the task description before proceeding!
Remember: models.W042 is raised on inherited manually specified primary key.
Description
	
I have models which inherit from other models, and they should inherit the primary key. This works fine with Django 3.1. However, if I install Django 3.2 alpha, when I run make_migrations I get the following error messages:

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: We found that models.W042 is emitted from django/db/models/base.py::_check_default_pk(). To proceed, I should inspect more context in base.py and related model option attributes to understand when pk.auto_created is True (e.g., for multi-table inheritance via parent_link OneToOneField). Additionally, per instructions, I should record this insight in task_description.txt, and it may be helpful to explore cls._meta attributes (like parents, proxy, concrete_model, pk.parent_link) to craft a precise condition that suppresses W042 for inherited PKs. I'll update the task description with what we learned and open a broader range in base.py and also quickly grep for parent_link handling.

```bash
printf "\n- _check_default_pk() triggers on cls._meta.pk.auto_created; likely True for multi-table inheritance parent_link PKs, causing false-positive W042.\n" >> task_description.txt && nl -ba django/db/models/base.py | sed -n '1200,1400p' && grep -Rin "parent_link" django/db/models | sed -n '1,120p'
```

THOUGHT: I need to inspect the relevant parts of ModelBase where parent_link primary keys are created to see if such PKs are marked as auto_created, which would erroneously trigger _check_default_pk(). I'll open the nearby code around where OneToOneField with parent_link=True is constructed to understand its attributes and how pk.auto_created is set. This will guide the fix (likely adjusting _check_default_pk to skip when the pk is a parent_link to an ancestor). I'll view a concise range around those lines.

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.



Additional insights (2026-05-05):
- The models.W042 warning is emitted from django/db/models/base.py around line 1317.

- _check_default_pk() triggers on cls._meta.pk.auto_created; likely True for multi-table inheritance parent_link PKs, causing false-positive W042.

```

THOUGHT: The W042 warning is emitted in Model._check_default_pk() when cls._meta.pk.auto_created is True. For multi-table inheritance, the child model's PK is a parent_link OneToOneField auto-created with auto_created=True even if the ancestor has an explicit PK type. This causes a false-positive W042. The fix is to skip the warning when the PK is a parent_link to a parent model. I'll:
- Append to task_description.txt the insight that the parent_link OneToOneField is auto_created=True and causes false positives.
- Patch django/db/models/base.py to early-return (no warning) when pk.remote_field.parent_link is True.
- Show the patched section to verify.

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.



Additional insights (2026-05-05):
- The models.W042 warning is emitted from django/db/models/base.py around line 1317.

- _check_default_pk() triggers on cls._meta.pk.auto_created; likely True for multi-table inheritance parent_link PKs, causing false-positive W042.

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: I've implemented a fix in django/db/models/base.py to suppress models.W042 for multi-table inheritance where the subclass PK is a parent_link to the parent, preventing false positives. I also documented insights in task_description.txt and verified behavior by running the check_framework tests, which all passed. I'm now submitting the final output.
