# CSCI-635
This project contains all artifacts generated as part of the replication study for [Live-SWE-Agent: Can Software engineering Agent self-evolve on the Fly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13646). The contents of this repo are broken down as follows:

- custom_configs - Contains the custom configuration files we created to replicate the ablation study and to enable prompt evolution for the enhancement.

- live-swe-agent - Contains the original source code and artifacts for live-swe-agent.

- mini-swe-agent-v1 - Contains the modified source code for mini-swe-agent v1, which we have modified in a few places to enable prompt evolution.

- results - Contains all results and related data for all experiments conducted during this study.

- scripts - Contains several helpful python and shell script we created to automate some of the process for running the experiments and evaluating results. 

- subsets - Contains csv files that list the instance names for the particular subset of problems from SWE-bench-verified we used in our experiments.

## Installation
If you want to work with the unaltered version of Live-SWE-Agent, first install mini-swe-agent following the instructions in the [Mini-SWE-agent Repo](https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent). *Be sure to install the v1 version. V2 is not compatible with Live-SWE-Agent.

If you're using our modified version of mini-swe-agent in order to support task and reflection prompt evolution, clone our repository and then run `pip install -e .` from the main directory of our repository. 

Follow the remaining installation steps regardless of which mini-swe-agent you installed.

If you want to be able to run evaluations using SWE-bench, be sure to also install datasets using `pip install datasets`

SWE-bench can be installed using the installation instructions in the [SWE-bench repository](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-bench).

## Running Live-SWE-agent on SWE-bench
In order to benchmark the performance of Live-SWE-Agent (both the default version and the one with our modifications), we have provided a script to simplify the process of running the subset of SWE-Bench problems that we use in our research.

The script can be executed in the command line with the following syntax:

`run_subset.sh   PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE   PATH_TO_CSV_FILE_OF_SWE_BENCH_INSTANCES   <PATH_TO_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>   <REDO_EXISTING_INSTANCES>`

Arguments encased in <> are optional. If no run directory is specified, a runs directory will be created in the current working directory. If the redo_existing_instances flag is left unspecified, it will default to false. 

## Evaluating the SWE-bench Predictions
Once the agent has finished processing all of the SWE-Bench issues, its performance can be evaluated using the following input on the command line:

` python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation     --dataset_name SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified     --predictions_path PATH_TO_PREDS.JSON_FILE     --run_id UNIQUE_RUN_ID `

If you want more statistics such as how much each instance cost and how many API calls were used, you can use the get_model_stats.py script as follows:

`python get_model_stats.py PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_RUN_OUTPUTS`

This will generate a CSV file containing the stats broken down for each instance. The file is stored in the directory provided in the input.
